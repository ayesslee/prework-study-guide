# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Study Guide was created for bootcamp students who are going through the vast amount of new information throughout the course prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This project was made in the hopes of helping bootcamp students to easily find and read information on a structured webpage. I learned that having notes to review helps retain information.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. As for what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing "Command + Option + I" on MacOs. For Windows you access it by pressing "Control + Shift + I". There should be a console panel that opens either on the bottom or to the side of the browser page. In the panel you will see a list of topics that we learned from thre prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study firstl.
